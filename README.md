# LingoSwap
LingoSwap is an innovative in-house translation app designed to streamline the translation process for key-value paired strings. Perfect for developers, localization teams, and content managers, LingoSwap takes a JSON file as input, where each key is a constant and the value is a string that needs to be translated into various languages.
